# finding_loci_based_off_primers
Uses BLAST and R scripts to find genomic position of loci based off their primer sequences and expected size

### Things you need
1. A genome in fasta format
2. A tab-delimited list of your primers with locus name in the 1st column, F primer (5' to 3') in the 2nd column, R primer (5' to 3') in the 3rd column, and expected size distribution (bp) in the 4th.
